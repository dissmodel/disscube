"""
Operator plugin system for disscube.

Every operator is a concrete subclass of ``Operator``.  Defining ``name``
on the subclass is the only registration step required — ``__init_subclass__``
inserts it into ``OPERATOR_REGISTRY`` automatically.

Adding a new operator:
1. Create a subclass of ``Operator`` anywhere that is imported at startup.
2. Set ``name`` and override ``resampling()`` / ``compute()`` as needed.
3. No changes to Aggregator or any other pipeline stage are required.

    Base class for all disscube derivation operators.

        ``OPERATOR_REGISTRY``.
    requires_class_code : bool

        at construction time (fail-fast validation).
    _resampling : Resampling
        Default rasterio resampling method used by ``GridAligner`` for
        raster sources.  Override in subclasses to match the operator's
        aggregation semantics.
